My name is Kevin and I live in Colorado Springs. In 2021, I started collecting, using, and repairing manual typewriters. Since then, I’ve learned a lot about these wonderful machines and even more about myself. This website is an attempt to share what I’ve learned and offer my services to those interested in the hobby, whether you are a collector, writer, or restorer.\n\nBegin Again Typewriters is named after a concept with roots in Zen Buddhism called beginner’s mind. I think of it as staying open to experience and treating each moment as an opportunity to learn and grow. Through trial and error, I’ve found no two machines are alike and every machine deserves respect. I’ve watched my overconfidence, anger, and inattention prolong a successful repair. I’ve proclaimed machines complete only to feed in a sheet of paper and watch the machine shrug and laugh at my naivety. Typewriter repair is a humbling craft, but in the end, the machines reward beginner’s mind.\n\nI am not the only typewriter hobbyist and restorer on the internet and I’ll never claim to be the best. What I do claim is to respect each machine, do the best work I’m capable of, and bring every machine as close to original and complete working condition as possible. A typewriter as a display piece or collector’s item is cool - but my focus is always on producing high functioning writing machines.\n\nI’m pretty shy about having an “online presence.” I am only one voice in a choir and my song isn’t new. But I’ve decided to put myself out there as tribute to others who have helped me. Maybe I can help you by answering a question or sparking an idea. Maybe I can fix your typewriter or hook you up with a fine slab of writing iron. Whether you’re a long-time collector or just curious about your first typewriter, you’re welcome to look around or shoot me a message. Just please be nice and I promise to do the same.\n\nTo me, typewriter repair and restoration is not just a hobby, a side hustle, or an early-onset midlife crisis. Well, yeah, that’s all part of it, too. But it’s also about slowing down, unplugging, and putting my mind on something tangible and constructive. In my life, typewriters began as a way of expressing my ideas with honesty and without a digital mediator. It has since become a vehicle to learn how to show up for my own life.","src/content/pages/about.mdx","27429ee3570e8c49",true,"articles",{"id":20,"data":22,"body":25,"filePath":26,"digest":27,"deferredRender":19},{"title":23,"description":24},"Articles","Articles about typewriter repairs and restoration.","import AllArticles from '@components/articles/AllArticles.astro';\n\nThings I wrote.\n\n\u003CAllArticles />","src/content/pages/articles.mdx","19e22369b0960bc4","contact",{"id":28,"data":30,"body":33,"filePath":34,"digest":35,"deferredRender":19},{"title":31,"description":32},"Contact","Contact page for Begin Again Typewriters.","Have a machine you want restored?

Instead of CTRL+T, I hit CTRL+R and refreshed the page. My fully written and proofread article was disappeared.\n\nI'm upset, but grateful for the lesson. I'm supposed to be on a journey to discover acceptance.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n2. The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\n3. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\n\nThese are not simply cute one-line poems, they are pangrams: sentences containing every letter of the alphabet. Go ahead, re-read them and see if you can spot each letter yourself. I’ll wait!\n\nThe legacy of pangrams is tied to typing machines because they make 26 unique demands of each finger over the course of one short sentence. As a typing exercise, they’re intended to build dexterity and train precise finger action on each key. You may remember them as pinky torture. Huh. “Pinky” is a word typed entirely with the right hand, and which requires the pinky to type the letter p. Pinky. pinkypinkypinkypinky. Ugh.\n\nI’ve always been a very strong touch typist but I’m not without my faults. So, to the hunt-and-peckers, fountain penners, and virtual screen thumbers: know that I judge no writing medium or skill level. Writing is good at any speed so long as it’s done using your mind.\n\nBy the way, did you know you’re meant to use both shift keys? Like, they’re not a lefty/righty handedness thing? Yeah, apparently, you’re supposed to shift left hand letters with the right shift key and vice versa. I never developed that skill, so now a lifetime of left-shifting on computer keyboards has left my right pinky useless on carriage shift machines.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nPangrams are not only useful for practicing touch typing, but they are also functional tools for typewriter restoration. A pangram is the first thing I type when I inspect a new machine. I use pangrams to check functionality throughout a restoration project. And a pangram will always appear on my final type sample of a completed machine. In fact, I decided to write one of my own:\n\nquick fix joy, zebra leaps thud. my vow, begin again.\n\nWhy go through the trouble? Because I am insane. But also because it gives me quick assessment of a variety of critical functions of the machine. Are the type bars moving freely and quickly? Is the imprint of each character clear and crisp? Is the ribbon vibrator satisfying? You heard me.","src/content/articles/type-samples-pt-1-panagrams.mdx","39a2f6a100fc07d2"]
