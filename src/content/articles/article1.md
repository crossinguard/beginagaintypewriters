I spent an entire evening writing a lovely article about pangrams. I did not click save at any point. My article was about touch typing, it was cool. It was charming. I was really happy with it. First win in a while. And then I made a typo. Instead of CTRL+T, I hit CTRL+R and refreshed the page. My fully written and proofread article was disappeared. 

I'm upset, but grateful for the lesson. I'm supposed to be on a journey to discover acceptance. I should acknowledge with equanimity that it is in the nature of all things to end - I was just attached to the idea of this particular article's end not coming before it was published to this lovely website for no one to read.

Stay tuned for an attempt to rewrite the article.
