For now this is just a colection of common content that will appear on this site to check styles.

# Header 1 Page Heading

This is an introductory paragraph with some **bold text** and *italic text* for emphasis. You might also use a [link to another page](/) or reference `inline code` within your prose.

## Header 2 Section Heading

Here's a regular paragraph under a second-level heading. It contains enough text to see how your body copy flows across multiple lines. Good typography makes a significant difference in readability.

### Header 3 Subsection Heading

Sometimes you need a third-level heading for nested content. This helps organize longer articles into digestible sections.

## Lists

Unordered list:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more detail
- Third item to round it out

Ordered list:

1. Step one of the process
2. Step two follows naturally
3. Step three completes the sequence

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use it for quotations, callouts, or to highlight important information that deserves visual distinction from surrounding text.

## Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

```css
.container {
  max-width: 720px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 2rem;
}
```
