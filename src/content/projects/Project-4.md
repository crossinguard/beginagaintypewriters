Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Just my luck, no ice. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. I was part of something special. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

> We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!

## Checkmate

Checkmate... You really think you can fly that thing? You really think you can fly that thing? I was part of something special. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist?

Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Remind me to thank John for a lovely weekend. You really think you can fly that thing?

So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
