# Begin Again Typewriters | Website

This repo houses the website files for [Begin Again Typerwriters](https://beginagaintypewriters.com), created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build). The approach used here is based on Andy Bell's [A CSS project boilerplate](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-css-project-boilerplate/). 

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `bun install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `bun astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `bun astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
