# Begin Again Typewriters | Website

This repo houses the website files for [Begin Again Typewriters](https://beginagaintypewriters.com), created using the [Astro web framework](https://astro.build) with a headless content management system through [Tina CMS](https://tina.io). 

The approach used here is based on Andy Bell's [A CSS project boilerplate](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-css-project-boilerplate/) and lessons learned in his course [Complete CSS](https://piccalil.li/complete-css/lessons).

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `bun dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `bun build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `bun preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
